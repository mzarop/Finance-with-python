    "# Security's risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk and return are the two most important dimensions on investment decision making.\n",
    "But how can we measure and forecast risk?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Risk?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example we bought a security with \\\\$1000(USD) and we know that the stock's average return is 15\\%.\n",
    "How was this average made whether:\n",
    "* The historical observations of earn are 14\\% the first year 16\\% the next year 13\\% the next year and 17\\% the last year?\n",
    "* Or the historical observations are +50\\% vs -20\\% vs -20\\% vs +50\\%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case we have a stable amount of earn over time (between 13\\% to 17\\%).\n",
    "But in the second case things change a lot because we have huge amount of variability between the observations. The average rate of return is the same but we can't have an idea of what comes next because of the huge variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hence variability plays an important role and it is best measure of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "A volatile market is more prone to deviate from the historical rate of returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people want to have a clear idea of the returns of a security or a portfolio of securities and they try to reduce the risk that they exposed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A great deal to help us quantify the risk are the statistical measures  Variance(S^2) and Standard deviation(S).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The variance of a security measures the dispersion of a set of data points around the mean.\n",
    "$$ S^2 = \\frac{Σ(Χ-\\bar{X})^2}{N-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, in the previous example the mean is 15\\% and we have to subtract from each of the observations in the power of two  and add the result.\n",
    "$ (14\\%-15\\%)^2 + (16\\% -15\\%)^2 + (13\\%-15\\%)^2 + (17\\% -15\\%)^2 $. These are the four dispersions from the mean in the power of two.\n",
    "After we have the result we have to divide by the number of observations minus one. In this case $4-1$.\n",
    "Finally we have the variance which is \n",
    "$$S^2=0.0333$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we'll take the square root of the $S^2$ we'll find the standard deviation:\n",
    "$$ S=\\sqrt{S^2}=1.8\\%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do the some thing for the second set of observations.\n",
    "We'll find $ S^2=16\\% $ and $S=\\sqrt{S^2}=40\\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion is that the second set has higher disporsions so is more risky that the first one.\n",
